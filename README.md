## ðŸŒŸ Introduction

#### "Earth provides enough to satisfy every man's need but not every man's greed."

* __Global warming__ is the increase of average world temperature as a result of what is known as the __greenhouse effect__. Certain __gases__ in the __atmosphere__ act like glass in a greenhouse, allowing sunlight through to __heat the earth__'s surface but trapping the heat as it radiates back into space.
* It's being __predicted__ that by the next century __Earth__ will see a rise of nearly __5&#176;C__ in the global __temperature__ due to __Global warming__.
* We believes this rise in temperature can be __restrained__ to lower temperature and aims to make it a __reality__ with this project .

## ðŸŒŸ Problem Statement

* __What is Global warming?__

  * Global warming is the long-term heating of Earth's climate system observed since the pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to human activities, primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth's atmosphere.

* __What causes Global warning?__

    * It is caused by increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, mainly from human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, industrial activities and farming.

* __How big is the Global Warming?__

    * Climate change is already happening: temperatures are rising, drought and wild fires are starting to occur more frequently, rainfall patterns are shifting, glaciers and snow are melting and the global mean sea level is rising.


## ðŸŒŸ About Project 
We created a web application that illustrates the rate at which this change is happening globally. We have visualised the correlations among various factors like temperature, greenhouse gas emissions, fossil fuel usages, electricity generation, catastrophes like droughts, floods and storms, and more. We have predicted the impact of these factors on the rising temperature and some of the global concerns like rising sea level or changes in glacier mass using machine learning algorithms. </p>

## ðŸŒŸ  Technology stack 
Web application along with visualisations and machine learning models are developed with Python only. </p>
We have used Dash and plotly </p>
